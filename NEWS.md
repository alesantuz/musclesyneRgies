- L2-normalisation within `synsNMF` is now 1.5-2x faster
- All code re-styled in [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/) using [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/)

# musclesyneRgies 0.9.4-beta

- All code re-styled with tidyverse style using styler, plus new logo!

v1.0.0 coming soon with function for calculating the short-term maximum Lyapunov exponents of motor primitives.

# musclesyneRgies 0.9.2-beta

- This not-so-minor update allows the user to extract synergies with a fixed rank.

# musclesyneRgies 0.9.1-beta

- `musclesyneRgies` is now a R package. Follow the README for a breakdown of the typical workflow. This is the first release, still in beta.

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.7-alpha

- Fixed a bug in the UMAP plots.

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.6-alpha

- Housekeeping and UMAP plots of mean filtered EMG.

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.5-alpha

- UMAP plots of classified synergies are saved in the NMF folder for advanced visualisation of factorisation/classification outcomes.

UMAP details:
McInnes, Leland, John Healy, and James Melville. "Umap: Uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction." arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03426 (2018).

R-package:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/umap/

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.4-alpha

- Raw EMG plots are now saved for each trial. The last `raw_pl` (see line 133) seconds of the trial are considered for plots.

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.3-alpha

- When reordering synergies manually during classification, the user can now repeat endlessly the classification if mistakes are made during input.

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.2-alpha

- A bit of housekeeping and now the clusters found by k-means classification are saved in one plot per condition.

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.1-alpha

- The robustness of k-means classification is improved and can now better deal with special cases of clusters with similar CoA and FWHM.

# musclesyneRgies 0.7.3-alpha

- Now the classification method is saved in the SYNS_classified list and can be used by step 4 (graph creation) to save the classification method in the file name.

# musclesyneRgies 0.7.2-alpha

- Now the classification method is saved in the file name when producing graph in step 4.

# musclesyneRgies 0.7.1-alpha

- First public API of `musclesyneRgies`
- Fixed a bug in section 4
