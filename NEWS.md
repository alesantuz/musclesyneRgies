# musclesyneRgies 0.8.7-alpha

R-package:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/umap/

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.4-alpha

- Raw EMG plots are now saved for each trial. The last `raw_pl` (see line 133) seconds of the trial are considered for plots.

- When reordering synergies manually during classification, the user can now repeat endlessly the classification if mistakes are made during input.

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.2-alpha

- A bit of housekeeping and now the clusters found by k-means classification are saved in one plot per condition.

# musclesyneRgies 0.8.1-alpha

- The robustness of k-means classification is improved and can now better deal with special cases of clusters with similar CoA and FWHM.

# musclesyneRgies 0.7.3-alpha

- Now the classification method is saved in the SYNS_classified list and can be used by step 4 (graph creation) to save the classification method in the file name.

# musclesyneRgies 0.7.2-alpha

- Now the classification method is saved in the file name when producing graph in step 4.

# musclesyneRgies 0.7.1-alpha

- First public API of `musclesyneRgies`
